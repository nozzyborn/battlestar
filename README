BATTLESTAR
==========
A multiplayer game based on Battlestar lore.
Provides client and server, both written in java.
Authors: David Gay and three other people whose names I will add later

I can't really add much here at this point, because we've just started the
project and I don't know anything about Battlestar. Once we get a few more
ideas solidified from our project lead (the Battlestar fan), I'll be able
to add a few more details here.

For this project, there isn't a need for everyone to learn Git. Therefore, I
will be maintaining the repo with whatever any of the four of us write.
